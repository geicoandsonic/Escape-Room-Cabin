A Cabin Escape Room I (with some assistance) made for A Game of Rooms in Rockville, Maryland. 
I learned so much on this project, from self teaching animations to creating, using and compressing textures. I went through a period of mass reduction of file size (for example, texture usage went from 820mb to 130mb after I learned how to use compression techniques).
This project features working UI with a fully fleshed out inventory system, viewing and using item system, numerous minigames, mechanics for opening locks in both 2D and 3D and more. Due to quirks with Unity and integration with Blender, occasionally I have noticed some objects disappear (two locks in particular). I do not believe this can softlock the game, but please let me know if you have any issues with the game. I will patch as soon as I can.
I plan on integrating some more features (the chess minigame is being completely redone to have a 3D view and rotational camera, allowing players to actually interact with the board and move all the pieces). Multiplayer is not currently planned, but as I learn more about it I will try and integrate it.
I have been given expressive permission from A Game of Rooms to use this game, and nearly all of the content that made it on is entirely out of office work. At this point it is purely a passion project.
If you have any issues, please reach out to me at johnwillskipper@gmail.com.
I hope you enjoy the game! Much work has gone into it.
